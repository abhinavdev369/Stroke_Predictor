Stroke Predictor is a web based application for machine learning designed to predict an individual's risk of stroke based on the health and the lifefstyle factos of the individual we consider.Built foe hospital use and also for students studying the topics, it provides a interpretable preddiction using SHAP(Shapley Additive Explanations) to highlight the key risk factors such as glucose levels, smoking status and offers personalized lifestyle recommendations. The designed website features a user-friendly interface with a risk meter visualisation included and voice input capabilities.

Features:
The prediction is performed using a neural network trained on the stroke prediction data to predict the risk of stroke
Explanability is performed by ShAP-based analysis and it shows which features drive the prediction.
It provides actionable lifestyle choices and advicce based on the risk factors detected.
The Web interface is built using Flask and BootStrap , including Forms(Flask-WTF), risk-meter, and voice input.
The Modular code for training is done seperately and can be scaled whenever necessary.
The dataset used is stroke_data1.csv
